## The WashU Virus Genome Browser

This Github repository hosts all of our publicly available scripts, such as those for generating json files and converting your pairwise alignment results into SNV tracks for upload onto the browser. 

This is also where users can submit issues and feedback.


Additional resources can be found here:

- [Documentation for the WashU Virus Genome Browser](https://virusgateway.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html)
- [A series of short tutorial videos is available](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCuIQetcmC5h1h_LXmhrlKrA)

Please keep in mind that we are actively updating the browser, adding new data tracks as data are released to the public. 


Any comments or suggestions for additional tracks can be directed to jflynn@wustl.edu or dpurushotham@wustl.edu
